# Determinants of Interest Rates

Interest rates are influenced by several key factors:

1. **Real Risk-Free Interest Rate**: This is the theoretical rate of return on an investment with zero risk, assuming no inflation. It reflects the time value of money.

2. **Inflation Premium**: This compensates investors for the expected loss of purchasing power due to inflation. It is added to the real risk-free rate to adjust for inflation.

3. **Default Risk Premium**: This compensates investors for the risk that the borrower may default on their obligations. Higher risk borrowers pay higher premiums.

4. **Liquidity Premium**: This compensates investors for the risk associated with the liquidity of an investment. Less liquid investments require a higher premium.

5. **Maturity Premium**: This compensates investors for the increased risk associated with longer-term investments. Generally, longer-term investments have higher interest rates due to this premium.

## Why is the Maturity Premium Generally Positive?

The maturity premium is generally positive because longer-term investments are exposed to more uncertainties and risks over time, such as changes in interest rates and economic conditions. Therefore, investors demand a higher return for committing their money for a longer period.

## What is the Real Risk-Free Interest Rate?

The real risk-free interest rate is the return on an investment with zero risk and no inflation. It represents the pure time value of money, reflecting the preference for current consumption over future consumption.

## Example Calculation

Given:
- Liquidity premium: 0.5%
- Default risk premium: 2%
- Inflation premium: 0%
- Maturity premium (6 years): 2% (assuming linear, 0.33% per year)

The total interest rate can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Total Interest Rate} = \text{Real Risk-Free Rate} + \text{Inflation Premium} + \text{Default Risk Premium} + \text{Liquidity Premium} + \text{Maturity Premium} \]

Assuming the real risk-free rate is 1.66%, the total interest rate would be:
\[ 1.66\% + 0\% + 2\% + 0.5\% + 2\% = 6.16\% \]

## Holding Period Return

A holding period return can be computed for a period longer than one year. For example, if you have three annual returns, you can compute the one-year holding period return by compounding the three annual returns:

\[ R = [(1 + R1) \times (1 + R2) \times (1 + R3)] - 1 \]

### Real-Life Scenario

Suppose you have a portfolio with annual returns of 22%, -25%, and 11% over three years. The one-year holding period return would be:

\[ R = [(1 + 0.22) \times (1 - 0.25) \times (1 + 0.11)] - 1 \]
\[ R = [1.22 \times 0.75 \times 1.11] - 1 \]
\[ R = 1.0052 - 1 = 0.0052 \text{ or } 0.52\% \]

### Geometric Mean Return

The geometric mean return over the three-year period is calculated as:

\[ \text{Geometric Mean Return} = [1.22 \times 0.75 \times 1.11]^{1/3} - 1 \]
\[ \text{Geometric Mean Return} = 1.0052^{1/3} - 1 \]
\[ \text{Geometric Mean Return} = 0.0052 \text{ or } 0.52\% \]

While your approach gave the correct answer, it is generally safer to use the geometric mean formula to avoid potential errors in different scenarios.

## Liquidity Premium and Slippage

The liquidity premium compensates investors for the risk of not being able to quickly buy or sell an investment without affecting its price. Slippage, often used in the context of cryptocurrencies, refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is executed. While related, slippage is a more specific term and not commonly used in traditional finance contexts.

## Maturity Premium

The maturity premium compensates investors for the increased risk associated with longer-term investments. It is not a subset of the liquidity premium because even highly liquid investments like US Treasury bonds have a maturity premium. The premium exists due to the additional risks and uncertainties over a longer time horizon.

## BGN Mode in Calculator

The BGN (Begin) mode on a financial calculator is used when payments are made at the beginning of each period, as opposed to the end (END mode). This is common in annuities due.

## Effective Annual Interest Rate

The effective annual interest rate (EAR) is the interest rate that is adjusted for compounding over a year. It represents the actual return on an investment or the actual cost of a loan.

## Future Value of an Annuity

The future value of an annuity can be calculated using the formula:

\[ FV_N = A \left[ \frac{(1 + r)^N - 1}{r} \right] \]

This formula simplifies the sum of a series of future cash flows.

## Present Value of an Ordinary Annuity

The present value of an ordinary annuity can be expressed as:

\[ PV = A \left[ \frac{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + r)^N}}{r} \right] \]

This formula is derived by summing the present values of each individual annuity payment.

## Nominal Risk-Free Interest Rate

The nominal risk-free interest rate is the sum of the real risk-free interest rate and the inflation premium. It does not include other premiums like liquidity, default risk, or maturity premiums. These additional premiums are added to the nominal risk-free rate to get the total interest rate for a specific investment.

## Study Tips

- **Flashcards**: Use flashcards to memorize key concepts and formulas.
- **Prerequisite Reading**: Allocate about 24 hours for prerequisite readings to build a strong foundation.
- **Practice Problems**: Regularly solve practice problems to reinforce understanding and application of concepts.
