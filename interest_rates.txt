Determinants of Interest Rates:
    1. real risk-free interest rate
    2. inflation premium
    3. default risk premium
    4. liquidity premium
    5. maturity premium

maturity premium is generally positive, as in interest rates in long term US treasury bonds are generally higher than that of shorter term bonds. Why?

What exactly is a real risk-free interest rate?

# pg. 15 question3 
liquidity premium: .5%
Deafult risk premium: 2%
inflation premium is zero
maturity premium (6yr): 2%
assuming linear than .33%/yr

A holding period return can be computed for a period longer than one year. For
example, an analyst may need to compute a one-year holding period return from
three annual returns. In that case, the one-year holding period return is computed
by compounding the three annual returns:
R = [(1 + R1) × (1 + R2) × (1 + R3)] − 1,
where R1, R2, and R3 are the three annual returns.

--> In what situation would you need to compute a one-year holding period return from three annual returns? Give me a simplified real-life scenario.

Annual return rates of year 1, 2, 3 of a portfolio is 22%, -25%, and 11%, respectively. The Geometric mean return over the three-year period is calculated as followed:
[1.22*0.75*1.11]^(1/3)-1=0.0052
However, I calculated it with [(1.22*0.75*1.11)-1]/3=0.0052

--> I got the answer correct, but I was wondering if my approach will lead to an incorrect solution in the future.

I understood liquidity premium, one of the components of nominal interest rate, as premium for slippage.
The CFA required readings do not mention this word, and instead describes the concept as "impact in price".
Is slippage a niche vocabulary for cryptocurrencies?

Maturity premimum is reflected in the interest rate differences of short-and-long-term treasury debts.
My intuition was that maturity premium is a subset of liquidity premium because it is a compensation for a trade-off in investment liquidity (due to longer lock-up period of longer treasury debts).
But I know this is not true because US treasury bonds are highly liquid in the open market regardless of its remaining time of maturity.
As in, I always have an option to liquidate my treasury debts by market selling it, even if it's a long-term security.
So I don't really understand what maturity premium is and why it exists in the first place.

What is "the BGN mode in the calculator"?

Effective annual interest rate: An interest rate with a periocity of one.

We can then define the future value as
FV𝑁=𝐴[(1+𝑟)𝑁−1+(1+𝑟)𝑁−2+(1+𝑟)𝑁−3+…+(1+𝑟)1+(1+𝑟)0] which simplifies to FV𝑁=𝐴[(1+𝑟)𝑁−1𝑟]

What is the name of this simplification theory?

Is there a formula on calculating the infinitely compounded future value of an annuity of uneven cash flows?
Is this different from a perpetuity?

We can express the present value of an ordinary annuity as the sum of the present values of each individual annuity payment, as follows:
PV=𝐴(1+𝑟)+𝐴(1+𝑟)2+𝐴(1+𝑟)3+…+𝐴(1+𝑟)𝑁−1+𝐴(1+𝑟)𝑁
10
where

A = the annuity amount

r = the interest rate per period corresponding to the frequency of annuity payments (for example, annual, quarterly, or monthly)

N = the number of annuity payments

Because the annuity payment (A) is a constant in this equation, it can be factored out as a common term. Thus the sum of the interest factors has a shortcut expression:

PV=𝐴1−1(1+𝑟)𝑁𝑟
I need a mathematical derivation of this.

Nominal risk-free interest rate is the sum of the real risk-free interest rate and the inflation premium.
But I thought nominal was real plus inflation premium plus liquidity premium plus maturity premium plus deafult premium??

According to the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting, which of the following is not an enhancing qualitative characteristic of information in financial statements?

A.Accuracy.
B.Timeliness.
C.Comparability.

C is wrong. A is correct. Accuracy is not an enhancing qualitative characteristic. Faithful representation, not accuracy, is a fundamental qualitative characteristic.

Which of the following is not a constraint on the financial statements according to the Conceptual Framework?

A.Understandability.
B.Benefit versus cost.
C.Balancing of qualitative characteristics.

C is wrong. A is correct. Understandability is an enhancing qualitative characteristic of financial information—not a constraint.

Conceptual Framework.

Valuing assets at the amount of cash or equivalents paid or the fair value of the consideration given to acquire them at the time of acquisition most closely describes which measurement of financial statement elements?

A.Current cost.
B.Historical cost.
C.Realizable value.

A is wrong. B is correct. Historical cost is the consideration paid to acquire an asset.

Which of the following elements of financial statements is most closely related to measurement of performance?

A.Assets.
B.Expenses.
C.Liabilities.

A is wrong. B is correct. The elements of financial statements related to the measure of performance are income and expenses.

A company’s profitability for a period would best be evaluated using the:

A.balance sheet.
B.income statement.
C.statement of cash flows.

C is wrong. B is correct. Profitability is the performance aspect measured by the income statement. The balance sheet portrays the financial position. The statement of cash flows presents a different aspect of performance.

A company’s profitability over a period of time is best evaluated using the:

A.balance sheet.
B.income statement.
C.cash flow statement.

C is wrong. B is correct. A company’s profitability is best evaluated using the income statement. The income statement presents information on the financial results of a company’s business activities over a period of time by communicating how much revenue was generated and the expenses incurred to generate that revenue.

You're absolutely correct that the accrual basis of accounting introduces the risk of recognizing revenue or expenses before cash is actually received or paid, which can lead to issues like unpaid credit or bad debts. However, this risk is managed through specific accounting practices and adjustments. Here's how:

2. bad debt expense: 실재한 채무불이행 기록
