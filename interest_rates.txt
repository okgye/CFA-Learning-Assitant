Determinants of Interest Rates:
    1. real risk-free interest rate
    2. inflation premium
    3. default risk premium
    4. liquidity premium
    5. maturity premium

maturity premium is generally positive, as in interest rates in long term US treasury bonds are generally higher than that of shorter term bonds. Why?

What exactly is a real risk-free interest rate?

# pg. 15 question3 
liquidity premium: .5%
Deafult risk premium: 2%
inflation premium is zero
maturity premium (6yr): 2%
assuming linear than .33%/yr

A holding period return can be computed for a period longer than one year. For
example, an analyst may need to compute a one-year holding period return from
three annual returns. In that case, the one-year holding period return is computed
by compounding the three annual returns:
R = [(1 + R1) × (1 + R2) × (1 + R3)] − 1,
where R1, R2, and R3 are the three annual returns.

--> In what situation would you need to compute a one-year holding period return from three annual returns? Give me a simplified real-life scenario.

Annual return rates of year 1, 2, 3 of a portfolio is 22%, -25%, and 11%, respectively. The Geometric mean return over the three-year period is calculated as followed:
[1.22*0.75*1.11]^(1/3)-1=0.0052
However, I calculated it with [(1.22*0.75*1.11)-1]/3=0.0052

--> I got the answer correct, but I was wondering if my approach will lead to an incorrect solution in the future.

I understood liquidity premium, one of the components of nominal interest rate, as premium for slippage.
The CFA required readings do not mention this word, and instead describes the concept as "impact in price".
Is slippage a niche vocabulary for cryptocurrencies?

Maturity premimum is reflected in the interest rate differences of short-and-long-term treasury debts.
My intuition was that maturity premium is a subset of liquidity premium because it is a compensation for a trade-off in investment liquidity (due to longer lock-up period of longer treasury debts).
But I know this is not true because US treasury bonds are highly liquid in the open market regardless of its remaining time of maturity.
As in, I always have an option to liquidate my treasury debts by market selling it, even if it's a long-term security.
So I don't really understand what maturity premium is and why it exists in the first place.

What is "the BGN mode in the calculator"?

Effective annual interest rate: An interest rate with a periocity of one.

We can then define the future value as
FV𝑁=𝐴[(1+𝑟)𝑁−1+(1+𝑟)𝑁−2+(1+𝑟)𝑁−3+…+(1+𝑟)1+(1+𝑟)0] which simplifies to FV𝑁=𝐴[(1+𝑟)𝑁−1𝑟]

What is the name of this simplification theory?

Is there a formula on calculating the infinitely compounded future value of an annuity of uneven cash flows?
Is this different from a perpetuity?

We can express the present value of an ordinary annuity as the sum of the present values of each individual annuity payment, as follows:
PV=𝐴(1+𝑟)+𝐴(1+𝑟)2+𝐴(1+𝑟)3+…+𝐴(1+𝑟)𝑁−1+𝐴(1+𝑟)𝑁
10
where

A = the annuity amount

r = the interest rate per period corresponding to the frequency of annuity payments (for example, annual, quarterly, or monthly)

N = the number of annuity payments

Because the annuity payment (A) is a constant in this equation, it can be factored out as a common term. Thus the sum of the interest factors has a shortcut expression:

PV=𝐴1−1(1+𝑟)𝑁𝑟
I need a mathematical derivation of this.

Nominal risk-free interest rate is the sum of the real risk-free interest rate and the inflation premium.
But I thought nominal was real plus inflation premium plus liquidity premium plus maturity premium plus deafult premium??
