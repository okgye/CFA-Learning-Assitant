Determinants of Interest Rates:
    1. real risk-free interest rate
    2. inflation premium
    3. default risk premium
    4. liquidity premium
    5. maturity premium

maturity premium is generally positive, as in interest rates in long term US treasury bonds are generally higher than that of shorter term bonds. Why?

What exactly is a real risk-free interest rate?

# pg. 15 question3 
liquidity premium: .5%
Deafult risk premium: 2%
inflation premium is zero
maturity premium (6yr): 2%
assuming linear than .33%/yr

A holding period return can be computed for a period longer than one year. For
example, an analyst may need to compute a one-year holding period return from
three annual returns. In that case, the one-year holding period return is computed
by compounding the three annual returns:
R = [(1 + R1) × (1 + R2) × (1 + R3)] − 1,
where R1, R2, and R3 are the three annual returns.

--> In what situation would you need to compute a one-year holding period return from three annual returns? Give me a simplified real-life scenario.

Annual return rates of year 1, 2, 3 of a portfolio is 22%, -25%, and 11%, respectively. The Geometric mean return over the three-year period is calculated as followed:
[1.22*0.75*1.11]^(1/3)-1=0.0052
However, I calculated it with [(1.22*0.75*1.11)-1]/3=0.0052

--> I got the answer correct, but I was wondering if my approach will lead to an incorrect solution in the future.
